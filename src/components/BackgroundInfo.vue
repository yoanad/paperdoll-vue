        This visualizations about raising awareness about the consequences of our shopping habits.
        Fast-fashion production requires huge amount of cotton and therefore water, therefore the choice you make about buying an outfit has a direct influence on the world.
        For instance, the origin of your t-shirt makes a big difference, because efficiency of cotton production is varies in different countries.
        We chose to compare the top 4 of seed cotton producing countries in how much a t-shirt and jeans would "cost" in litres, if the cotton was produced in this country.
